#### An optimized viewer for the coachella music festival with an emphasis on UX.

I didn't want to fork out $500 for a ticket & the event was livestreaming on youtube so I tooled around with building a viewer that
would allow users to keep a high level view of all the stages with small video panes and have the ability to effortlessly zoom to full screen and dim the background 
stages on a mouseover event.

So I grabbed some HTML5 Boilerplate, tracked down a coachella font .tff file, generated a web font with [font-squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)
and played around with youtubes API.

I stopped working on this as Coachella ended and I had lost inspiration but I will try to get a better version out before next years festival.
